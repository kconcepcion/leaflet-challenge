# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 challenge

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Create the Earthquake Visualization
* Dataset was retrieved from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
* Using Leaflet, a map was created that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
* Included a popup that provides additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
